# Route-Optimization-Problem
This Python code implements a route optimization system for delivery drivers, leveraging the OR-Tools library. It processes store location data and employs a vehicle routing problem (VRP) solver to generate efficient delivery routes, minimizing total travel distance.

# **Route Optimization for London Locations 🚗📍**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **route optimization** for store locations in **London** using **OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks** and **Google OR-Tools** for solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The goal is to compute the most efficient delivery or visit routes based on real-world road networks.  

---

## **📂 Dataset Description**  

The dataset contains store locations across various cities, including **London**, with latitude and longitude coordinates. The dataset is filtered to **London-only locations** before route optimization.  

### **📝 File: `data_stores.csv`**  
This file contains information about store locations, including:  

| Column Name        | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `Brand`          | Name of the store (e.g., Starbucks) |
| `Store Number`   | Unique identifier for the store |
| `Store Name`     | Name of the store location |
| `Ownership Type` | Whether the store is company-owned or licensed |
| `Street Address` | Full street address of the store |
| `City`           | City where the store is located |
| `State/Province` | State or province of the store location |
| `Country`        | Country code (ISO format) |
| `Postcode`       | Postal code of the store |
| `Phone Number`   | Contact number of the store |
| `Timezone`       | Timezone of the store |
| `Longitude`      | Geographic longitude coordinate |
| `Latitude`       | Geographic latitude coordinate |

## **🛠 Technologies Used**  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **OpenStreetMap (`osmnx`)** for extracting road networks  
- **NetworkX (`nx`)** for shortest path computations  
- **Google OR-Tools (`ortools`)** for route optimization  
- **Folium & Plotly** for route visualization  

---

## **🚀 How It Works**  
1. **Filter the dataset** to select only **London-based stores**.  
2. **Construct a road network** using OpenStreetMap (`osmnx`).  
3. **Compute travel times** between store locations using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.  
4. **Solve the optimal route** using **Google OR-Tools** for a **single driver (TSP Solver)**.  
5. **Visualize the route** on an interactive Folium map.

## **📍 Key Features**  
✔ Extracts real-world **road networks** from OpenStreetMap  
✔ Uses **graph-based shortest path algorithms**  
✔ Implements **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) optimization**  
✔ Outputs an **optimized route** for delivery or site visits  
✔ **Visualizes** routes on an interactive map

## **💡 Usage**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install osmnx ortools folium plotly networkx pandas numpy
```

### **2️⃣ Run the Script**
```bash
python route_optimization.py
```

### **3️⃣ View the Output**
- The script will **print the optimized route** (list of store nodes).  
- It will **generate an interactive map** with the optimized route.

## **👀 Future Enhancements**  
🔹 Add support for **multiple drivers (VRP - Vehicle Routing Problem)**  
🔹 Integrate **real-time traffic data** for better route estimation  
🔹 Develop a **web interface** for interactive routing
